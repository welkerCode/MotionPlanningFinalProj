Local Repair A* (Cooperative Path finding)
	Run A* for all agents
	Iterate through, moving them
	If collide, then path around each other
	Plan detour as opposed to a replan
	About to move to the next state, check collisions
	
	Heirarchal Cooperative aca*
		Reverse A* comes
	

Windowed Version of ACA
	Reverse planning is limited to 
	Plans 10, after moving half, replan
	Allows agents to not have as strong of prioirity


Regret Analysis
	Bidding war when assigning tasks
	Assign tasks after certain time steps
	Will the agents be moving while other agents being planned?

True distance NOT, use basic manhattan distance.instead
	Replace true heur with manhattan

Lifelong
	Outer loop in main that reruns the path finding
		Depends on list of tasks
		Slowly plans, and something to add tasks to that list
		Init set, hand out every few timesteps, and add to the list if we need to make it longer.
	Task assigned over time
