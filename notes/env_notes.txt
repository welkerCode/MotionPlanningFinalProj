env.py functionality:

- Basic animation of agent paths with simplified version of Paul's code

- when ran from command line, displays test animations on Warehouse
  environment.

- GridMap class creates maps based of text file of endpoints (e) and occupied grids (x)
- when GridMap.display_map() is passed a list of agent paths, it animates
  the movements of all agents.
